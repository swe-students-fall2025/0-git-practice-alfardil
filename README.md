# Vibe Coding

#### Article

This [article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/) talks about the dangers of vibe coding.

#### Analysis

Yes... while AI might be the future and AI may code faster than humans, it doesn't mean we should blindly be accepting everything we get from AI. This article describes a scenario where someone blindly trusted AI to make their entire app, and it led to them in <b>tears</b>. They're not wrong comparing AI to a kid that can make mistakes. The article also mentions `Lovable` as their vibe coding app of choice, which is interesting because I've only really heard of people using IDEs like `Cursor` or `Windsurf` to vibe code their applications.

#### Comments

@xl4624: I agree to an extent. I think there is a scale on manually writing code and using AI only as an assistant vs letting the AI write the entire project. When fully vibe coding, the complexities of the project could very likely grow exponentially until the code becomes unwieldy and the best action is to scrap the whole project and restart. But there is a benefit of being on this end, AI makes it incredibly fast to try out new ideas and prototype without too much thinking. In general, I think that where you stand on this AI scale should be flexible and depends on the situation.
